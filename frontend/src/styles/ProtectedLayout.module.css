   IMPORTANT:
   The .loadingOverlay styles (spinner, loadingBar, etc.) should also be
   present either directly in this file, or imported from a shared file.
   If you have them only in GenerateQuiz.module.css and ProtectedLayout.js
   is importing them from there (as shown in my previous example), then
   that's fine. Just ensure they are accessible.
